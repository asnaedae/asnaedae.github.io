      <description>So was at airport yesterday, woke up early to make sure we&amp;rsquo;d get there in time, lo and behold TimesOnline on the 5am BBC bulletin, and as soon as they mentioned the two sets of &amp;ldquo;BA planes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;radiation&amp;rdquo; I just knew it&amp;rsquo;d be on the flights to Domodedevo!
Aside from that, airport was nice and quiet, sitting around before check-in, up wanders a gentleman and asks if we&amp;rsquo;re flying to Moscow, so I reply in the affirmative and a few questions later I find myself in front of a Channel 4 TV camera - DOH!</description>
