      <description>Well, been playing with opensolaris and they use mercurial as a DSVN - and another benefit of that over git is that the command set is very much similar to SVN/Subversion - which is important for us people who /don&amp;rsquo;t/ use it every day.
Migrating was straight-forward:
$ mkdir ~/svn &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd ~/svn $ hgimportsvn https://dubdubdub.co.uk/svn/mike $ find . -name .svn -type d | xargs rm -rf One thing to note when using - which took me a bit of reading to realise - it&amp;rsquo;s distributed, so if you&amp;rsquo;ve your own local copy - you have to commit and then push/pull changes out!</description>
