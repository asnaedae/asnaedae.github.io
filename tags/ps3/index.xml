      <description>Well finally borrowed an USB disk big enough - though the actual backup of the playstation ended up at 8GB it complained about fitting on my USB drive. So aside from a simple backup of the old drive via the XMB tool. Replace the old 40GB 2.5&amp;rdquo; SATA drive with a nice shiny 320GB model (and then restored from the USB drive)
Quite a few guides on the interweb about how to do that, but I&amp;rsquo;m still slightly shocked that Sony are using standard parts these days!</description>
