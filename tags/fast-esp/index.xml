      <description>well this is slightly surprising, but in a very good way, and does lead to some interesting suggestions on how to best to improve matters, but look at the following graph of FAST ESP query latency:
Notice that the average latency drops as we use the server more . . . but WHY? Well that&amp;rsquo;s just because we&amp;rsquo;re running the FAST indexes on a ZFS based file system and the L2 ARC cache is making it&amp;rsquo;s presence felt</description>
