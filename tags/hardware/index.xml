      <description>Well finally borrowed an USB disk big enough - though the actual backup of the playstation ended up at 8GB it complained about fitting on my USB drive. So aside from a simple backup of the old drive via the XMB tool. Replace the old 40GB 2.5&amp;rdquo; SATA drive with a nice shiny 320GB model (and then restored from the USB drive)
Quite a few guides on the interweb about how to do that, but I&amp;rsquo;m still slightly shocked that Sony are using standard parts these days!</description>

      <description>First I had to ensure that the stock debian packages are available for installation:
$ tail /etc/apt/sources.list deb http://archive.debian.org/debian etch main Install g++ and other dependencies
$ apt-get install g++ libpam0g-dev Download google-authenticator source code:
$ git clone https://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/ $ cd google-authenticator/ $ ./configure &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make install Then simply follow the instructions over at here</description>
