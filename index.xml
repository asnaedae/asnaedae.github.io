      <description>Just a collection of annoyances on Kubernetes:
kubectl config and multiple namespaces Seriously! The shear amount of YAML duplication if you have a large number of namespaces and clusters it quite rapidly becomes very annoying, do remember that this is YAML so you could have (ab)used anchors to copy commonly used fragments:
apiVersion: v1 clusters: - cluster: server: https://cluster1.example.com name: cluster1 contexts: - context: &amp;amp;bar-ns cluster: cluster1 namespace: bar-namespace user: &amp;#34;cluster1-user&amp;#34; name: cluster1-bar-namespace - context: &amp;lt;&amp;lt;: *bar-ns namespace: foo-namespace name: cluster1-foo-namespace - context: &amp;lt;&amp;lt;: *bar-ns namespace: kube-system name: cluster1-kubesystem current-context: cluster1-foo-namespace kind: Config preferences: {} users: [] CURRENT NAME CLUSTER AUTHINFO NAMESPACE * cluster1-foo-namespace cluster1 foo-namespace cluster1-kubesystem cluster1 kube-system cluster1-bar-namespace cluster1 bar-namespace Except: as soon as you use kubectl config use-context it goes and helpfully writes back the expanded YAML structure.</description>

      <description>Had a strange error being reported when exporting features from a Drupal 7 instance, in that the resultant tar file was not extracting using any of the usual tools, such as tar etc.
$ file features_export-7.x-1.0-alpha1.tar features_export-7.x-1.0-alpha1.tar: data File magic showed that the file was wrong, but looking at the file itself looked correct at first glance, and a look around on Drupal.org returned this old thread which lead me to</description>

      <description>Capistrano and Changelogs I needed a more atomic method of listing changes between two deployments whilst using capistrano, so used the following task to perform a git log between two revisions:
use the following to display:
$ cap deploy:changelog INFO Changes between 04e7f9a and 3fd3e88 releases INFO e7770ab Built Deployable files from Drush make 8f9d13c Built Deployable files from Drush make 3872d29 Built Deployable files from Drush make 193aaad Built Deployable files from Drush make You can then of course include within any other tasks using the normal capistrano methods</description>

      <description>User access times with Atlassian tools You&amp;rsquo;d be mistaken if you had a few searches on the internet and found the following page suggesting that you could just query the application cwd_user table except when using Crowd when you should query against the crowd cwd_user_attribute table.
Unfortunately that might have been true back with Jira 4.3, although in the last few years mixing the Atlassian tools (with Crowd as SSO provider) this is no longer the case and I&amp;rsquo;ve found the following MySQL query works well to find out login times for each application</description>

      <description>Agile at the right level There has been lots of criticism that &amp;ldquo;Agile&amp;rdquo; is a poor way to run any form of IT development project, with the following comments being made to substantiate the statement:
 No one uses &amp;ldquo;agile&amp;rdquo; in real world engineering It doesn&amp;rsquo;t scale It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo;  Indeed everyone seems to think that Royce&amp;rsquo;s original article in the 1970s was an example of a working project delivery method and miss that he presented it as a broken model.</description>

      <description>So whilst moving between github organisations - which is relatively straight forward, I also had to move some from Atlassian Stash unfortunately there&amp;rsquo;s not as simple a method to do this, but a good way of mirroring between two repos is as follows:
$ git clone https://donor_repo/example1 --bare $ git remote set-url --push origin https://destination_repo/example2.git $ git fetch -p origin &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git push --mirror Simples.</description>

Bundler, the underlying system Vagrant uses to install plugins, reported an error. The error is shown below. These errors are usually caused by misconfigured plugin installations or transient network issues.

Look at the current Microsoft mobile phone marketing Lumia:

And with Microsoft Office and OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) built in, you can keep on top of your work even when away from your desk</description>

 Simple HTML - 1999 Roxen - 2005 Wordpress Drupal Wordpress (again) Blogger Ghost  I&amp;rsquo;ve had a dabble with Jekyll in the past (specifically Heckle) whilst I was playing with moving things to Ghost and given I have already migrated all of my content into Markdown it sounded like the best option (especially given I don&amp;rsquo;t have to then host the application somewhere)</description>

$ brew install packer Cloning into &amp;#39;/opt/boxen/homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-binary&amp;#39;... remote: Reusing existing pack: 143, done.</description>

      <description>Ahh, so Apple&amp;rsquo;s Remote Desktop is just a simpler implementation of the VNC protocol (I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s some propriety extensions in there but it&amp;rsquo;s nice to know you can use vncclient to connect to a Mac.
Options that work well for VNC:-
[Connection] Host=$HOSTNAME [Options] UseLocalCursor=1 UseDesktopResize=1 FullScreen=0 FullColour=1 LowColourLevel=1 PreferredEncoding=hextile AutoSelect=0 Shared=0 SendPtrEvents=1 SendKeyEvents=1 SendCutText=1 AcceptCutText=1 DisableWinKeys=1 Emulate3=0 PointerEventInterval=0 Monitor= MenuKey=F8 AutoReconnect=1 Not the fastest thing in the planet, but only enabling the Hextile option seems to work ok.</description>

      <description>Run into a situation recently where proxying applications with nginx has masked the source IP - which normally is just annoying, but with Atlassian&amp;rsquo;s Crowd it&amp;rsquo;s more of a problem, this can be solved in later versions (Tomcat 6.0.32+) as follows:
&amp;lt;Valve className=&amp;#34;org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteIpValve&amp;#34; internalProxies=&amp;#34;proxy_IP_address&amp;#34; remoteIpHeader=&amp;#34;x-forwarded-for&amp;#34; remoteIpProxiesHeader=&amp;#34;x-forwarded-by&amp;#34; protocolHeader=&amp;#34;x-forwarded-proto&amp;#34; /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Valve className=&amp;#34;org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve&amp;#34; directory=&amp;#34;logs&amp;#34; prefix=&amp;#34;localhost_access.&amp;#34; suffix=&amp;#34;.log&amp;#34; pattern=&amp;#34;combined&amp;#34; resolveHosts=&amp;#34;false&amp;#34; /&amp;gt; The following should be used within nginx to forward that data into tomcat.
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server $host; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr; </description>

      <description>So in the last week we have had the announcement from both HMV and Blockbuster UK that they are entering administration and so cannot continue to trade as they used to, at the very least.
I suspect it&amp;rsquo;s not very surprising that both companies primarily dealt with &amp;ldquo;media&amp;rdquo; of one form or the other that, with the increasing availability of bandwidth to end users, are easily converted to digital forms and so the intrinsic costs of bricks and motar stores become a serious overhead.</description>

This isn&amp;rsquo;t the five stages of grief as defined by Kübler-Ross, that is aimed at the patient themselves not the family although you can see the use of the framework but something altogether subtler and harder to describe.</description>

      <description>A post written by Tor started me thinking about business and product development, especially in this age of online products. Classically, and not so many years ago, a company would have years in which to develop and maintain a new product (such as friends-reunited) and then have years to recoup any investment and of course profit!
However in the current markets, there are lots of people, with easy access to both the talent and technologies (developers and already pre-scaled technologies such as Amazon Web Services), that allows for almost any small startup to be able to deliver a globally accessible and scalable web application in essentially a very much shorter development cycle than many &amp;ldquo;classical&amp;rdquo; companies can manage.</description>

      <description>So at least with Java 1.6 the JVM can use SOCKS for proxying RMI requests, so to get the wonderful jvisualvm (think 1.5 visualGC) working use the following incantations. This requires the initial RMI registry port is open to the client. First the initial SSH to server enabling the SOCKS tunnel
{% highlight bash %} $ ssh -D localhost:9696 servername {% endhighlight %}
And now for jvisualvm:
{% highlight bash %} $ jvisualvm</description>

      <description>Sometimes you just need to tunnel UDP based protocols - such as SNMP - and the easiest ways is to use socat
$ socat tcp4-listen:6667,reuseaddr,fork UDP:DESTINATION:161 $ socat udp4-listen:161,reuseaddr,fork tcp:localhost:6667 And in combination with your normal SSH tunnel
$ ssh -L6667:localhost:6667 BASTION_HOST </description>

extraargs = -H Content-Type:text/xml --data @/srv/scripts/soap_check/soap-test.xml urlformat = http://server.name.com/url/soap_url The only annoying problem is that the SOAP payload cannot be included as part of the command line, so any slaves would require the file manually copied into the same location</description>

      <description>Well finally borrowed an USB disk big enough - though the actual backup of the playstation ended up at 8GB it complained about fitting on my USB drive. So aside from a simple backup of the old drive via the XMB tool. Replace the old 40GB 2.5&amp;rdquo; SATA drive with a nice shiny 320GB model (and then restored from the USB drive)
Quite a few guides on the interweb about how to do that, but I&amp;rsquo;m still slightly shocked that Sony are using standard parts these days!</description>

I was receiving a few errors when trying to spotlight for applications (well they didn&amp;rsquo;t appear) - running
$ sudo mdutil -i off / Error, no index found for volume. What worked to fix this for me was to move the main volume into the privacy section of spotlight and reboot (though i&amp;rsquo;d expect restarting fseventd might have the same effect) and then remove the volume from Privacy, 10 minutes later and disk has re-indexed and spotlight is working correctly.</description>

      <description>Well, been playing with opensolaris and they use mercurial as a DSVN - and another benefit of that over git is that the command set is very much similar to SVN/Subversion - which is important for us people who /don&amp;rsquo;t/ use it every day.
Migrating was straight-forward:
$ mkdir ~/svn &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd ~/svn $ hgimportsvn https://dubdubdub.co.uk/svn/mike $ find . -name .svn -type d | xargs rm -rf One thing to note when using - which took me a bit of reading to realise - it&amp;rsquo;s distributed, so if you&amp;rsquo;ve your own local copy - you have to commit and then push/pull changes out!</description>

      <description>well this is slightly surprising, but in a very good way, and does lead to some interesting suggestions on how to best to improve matters, but look at the following graph of FAST ESP query latency:
Notice that the average latency drops as we use the server more . . . but WHY? Well that&amp;rsquo;s just because we&amp;rsquo;re running the FAST indexes on a ZFS based file system and the L2 ARC cache is making it&amp;rsquo;s presence felt</description>

      <description>dladm is a new command with solaris 10 which can do many clever things (I think the general idea behind it is that ifconfig was becoming bloated with features and options that it was a good idea to break the link between the physical network provision and the logical usage)
ie: dladm - physical link provision/configuration ifconfig - logical link configuration  Assuming a server with two gigabit ethernet connections connected to two switches (for physical resillience):-</description>

      <description>Following reply by iljitsch van Beijnum about queueing delays in IP, looked to be a good little summary.
 The answer is that delay is only one aspect of performance, another important one is packet loss. As link bandwidth increases, queuing delays decrease proportionally. So if you’re using your 10 Mbps link with average 500 byte packets at 98% capacity, you’ll generally have a 49-packet queue. (queue = utilization / (1 - utilization)) Our 500 byte packets are transmitted at 0.</description>

      <description>Oh interesting stuff there - I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked the idea of FAST (not cheap as a search platform) but they&amp;rsquo;ve certainly thought a bit about how to scale - will be interesting to see if this mean&amp;rsquo;s a change to the supported platforms and roadmap moving forward

      <title>piracy in the real world</title>

      <description>well was quite strange this evening as I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished Frederick Forsythe&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Afghan&amp;rdquo;, which giving the game away slighly deals with some terrorists stealing a large ship or two. So I was having quite a sense of déjà-vu watching a documentary on one of the discovery channels about the same subject. Or of course it might just be that the film-makers read the same books!
Though they did raise a few good points about the close of the cold war allowing for a large surge in the numbers of piracy encounters in recent years, as the drop in the numbers of regular navy vessels in the oceans fell, though I&amp;rsquo;m also wondering if the increase in the freedom of information as well as increased availability of arms - such as the RPG7 - also has something to do with it.</description>

      <description>Well there is some undocumented methods to make time machine work on non-locally attached storage, and although it might be disabled in patches - this works pretty well:
As a regular user and in a terminal
$ defaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1 Then when you visit the time machine preferences you can choose a network share as a TM location. Now it&amp;rsquo;s very tempting to get a little mac mini for some zfs/nfs goodness</description>

      <description>Heh, well ok, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know but when abroad and you need to use google, it can be slightly tricky to use if you don&amp;rsquo;t know the local language.
So if you use :-
Norwegian Google Homepage It&amp;rsquo;ll change your default language to english - this also works with changing back to anything like
Russian Google Homepage To swap yourself to Russian - very helpful - previously i was also hand adding ?</description>

      <description>Well we were sitting down eating pizza, and watching the kids down below “losing” their balloons, after an hour or so there was a pretty large collection of them sitting around the roof. Now question is whether someone went up there to bring them down, or did they just wait a few days for the helium to leak out?
Unfortunately, only had my phone with me – so not as nice a picture as it could’ve been – still, and interesting view.</description>

      <description>so one shiny nokia e65, and a bit of frustration, later; have found the following recipe for getting the phone to sync correctly with iSync.
Firstly download the plugin from Nokia
Then install and if you get a rather cryptic error like this:
[Nokia E65] Device is not available or synchronization was cancelled. Close dialogs and applications on the phone and try again. Device “Nokia E65″ synchronization failed Looks like the Nokia installer drops the plugin into a strange location (originally it allowed isync to work once and then I got the error message</description>

      <description>Configure the zone you want, this is just a basic configuration (suited to a name server - that inherits the global zones /var/named)
# zonecfg -z solzone solzone: No such zone configured Use &amp;#39;create&amp;#39; to begin configuring a new zone. zonecfg:solzone&amp;gt; create zonecfg:solzone&amp;gt; set zonepath=/u01/zones/solzone zonecfg:solzone&amp;gt; set autoboot=true zonecfg:solzone&amp;gt; add net zonecfg:solzone:net&amp;gt; set address=10.10.10.20/24 zonecfg:solzone:net&amp;gt; set physical=bge0 zonecfg:solzone:net&amp;gt; end zonecfg:solzone&amp;gt; add fs zonecfg:solzone:fs&amp;gt; set type=lofs zonecfg:solzone:fs&amp;gt; set special=/u01/zonedata/solzone zonecfg:solzone:fs&amp;gt; set dir=/u01 zonecfg:solzone:fs&amp;gt; end zonecfg:solzone&amp;gt; add inherit-pkg-dir zonecfg:solzone:inherit-pkg-dir&amp;gt; set dir=/var/named zonecfg:solzone:inherit-pkg-dir&amp;gt; end zonecfg:solzone&amp;gt; add attr zonecfg:solzone:attr&amp;gt; set name=comment zonecfg:solzone:attr&amp;gt; set type=string zonecfg:solzone:attr&amp;gt; set value=&amp;#34;test solaris zone&amp;#34; zonecfg:solzone:attr&amp;gt; end zonecfg:solzone&amp;gt; verify zonecfg:solzone&amp;gt; commit zonecfg:solzone&amp;gt; exit And now install and boot the zone</description>

      <description>So was at airport yesterday, woke up early to make sure we&amp;rsquo;d get there in time, lo and behold TimesOnline on the 5am BBC bulletin, and as soon as they mentioned the two sets of &amp;ldquo;BA planes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;radiation&amp;rdquo; I just knew it&amp;rsquo;d be on the flights to Domodedevo!
Aside from that, airport was nice and quiet, sitting around before check-in, up wanders a gentleman and asks if we&amp;rsquo;re flying to Moscow, so I reply in the affirmative and a few questions later I find myself in front of a Channel 4 TV camera - DOH!</description>

      <description>It’s been a bug-bear for a long time for me that the CPU metrics when querying a Solaris 10 host are global and not zone specific (which of course makes sense, just makes it harder to track zone utilisation).
So finally wrote a basic perl script that will provide that information via a SNMP mib, output looks like the following:
&amp;gt; snmpwalk -v 1 -c public localhost .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.255.7 UCD-SNMP-MIB::ucdavis.255.7.0 = STRING: &amp;#34;Zone name&amp;#34; UCD-SNMP-MIB::ucdavis.</description>

      <description>well, finally tried out CQB (close quarter battle), definitely seems to be lot of full-auto with hicap mags, so you’re looking at pretty much being suppressed/suppressing all the time - so normally you move and get shot down in a hail of plastic!
Had a restricted ammo loadout game which was seriously good fun, Mr MP5K with a midcap worked really well in semi-auto mode. Got a few kills before running out of ammo (bloody glock got a jam - go figure)</description>

services fail to start – basically forward/reverse DNS must match  greebo:~ localad$ sudo changeip -checkhostname Primary address = 172.16.10.196 Current HostName = greebo.snarc.co.uk DNS HostName = greebo.snarc.co.uk  names match. There is nothing to change.
 So I cheated and am running split horizon DNS, I’ve not done the following – but is here as a reminder (and if I ever have enough disk space)</description>
