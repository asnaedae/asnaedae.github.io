So in the last week we have had the announcement from both HMV and Blockbuster UK that they are entering administration and so cannot continue to trade as they used to, at the very least.

I suspect it's not very surprising that both companies primarily dealt with "media" of one form or the other that, with the increasing availability of bandwidth to end users, are easily converted to digital forms and so the intrinsic costs of bricks and motar stores become a serious overhead.

So far we've seen something similar with mainstream "newspapers" being one of the first to go, with plummeting circulation and advertising revenues, I do wonder if we'll see something similar if widespread home 3d printing becomes a reality.
