So was at airport yesterday, woke up early to make sure we'd get there in time,
lo and behold [TimesOnline](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2478909.html)
on the 5am BBC bulletin, and as soon as they mentioned the two sets of "BA planes" and
"radiation" I just knew it'd be on the flights to Domodedevo!

Aside from that, airport was nice and quiet, sitting around before check-in, up
wanders a gentleman and asks if we're flying to Moscow, so I reply in the
affirmative and a few questions later I find myself in front of a Channel 4
TV camera - DOH!

Welcome to my 15 minutes of fame, and just to add added spice to it all, the
clip is being shown on one of the Russian channels every 5 minutes or so!
Think next time I'm just going to stay at home.
