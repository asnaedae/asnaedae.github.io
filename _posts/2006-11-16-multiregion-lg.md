Finally found the hidden menu for the DVD player (LG DNX 190UH):-

Turn On the unit with the remote controller
Wait until "no disc" appears in the unit's display
Press PAUSE, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9

This brings up the menu, select the region code that you want to change to or select 0 for multi-region.
Press PAUSE to exit.
