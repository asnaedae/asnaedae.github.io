well was quite strange this evening as I've just finished Frederick Forsythe's "The Afghan", which giving the game away slighly deals with some terrorists stealing a large ship or two. So I was having quite a sense of déjà-vu watching a documentary on one of the discovery channels about the same subject. Or of course it might just be that the film-makers read the same books!

Though they did raise a few good points about the close of the cold war allowing for a large surge in the numbers of piracy encounters in recent years, as the drop in the numbers of regular navy vessels in the oceans fell, though I'm also wondering if the increase in the freedom of information as well as increased availability of arms - such as the RPG7 - also has something to do with it. All in all a good show; despite my thinking that I've already heard of most of it!
