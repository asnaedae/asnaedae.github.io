Heh, well ok, I didn't know but when abroad and you need to use google, it can
 be slightly tricky to use if you don't know the local language.

So if you use :-

[Norwegian Google Homepage](http://www.google.no/en)
It'll change your default language to english - this also works with changing
back to anything like

[Russian Google Homepage](http://www.google.co.uk/ru)
To swap yourself to Russian - very helpful - previously i was also hand adding `?hl=en` to do a similar thing.

Another tip, if you cancel the flight - you can claim back flight duty and tax
even if you can't claim on the airfare - and that's normally a reasonable chunk
of change for long flights!
