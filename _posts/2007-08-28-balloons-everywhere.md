Well we were sitting down eating pizza, and watching the kids down below “loosing” their balloons, after an hour or so there was a pretty large collection of them sitting around the roof. Now question is whether someone went up there to bring them down, or did they just wait a few days for the helium to leak out?

Unfortunately, only had my phone with me – so not as nice a picture as it could’ve been – still, and interesting view.
