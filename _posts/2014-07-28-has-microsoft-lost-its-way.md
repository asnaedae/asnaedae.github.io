I cannot help but feel, very probably not helped by the rest of the tech press
that Microsoft is still struggling to understand what it's core market is and
how to move forward.

Look at the current Microsoft mobile phone marketing [Lumia](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-gb/phones):

> Plus, you’ll stay productive on the go with Microsoft Office Mobile built in
>
> And with Microsoft Office and OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) built in, you can
> keep on top of your work even when away from your desk

Umm, I know quite a few of us do work silly hours, or at least are responding to
emails at far wider hours than the old fashioned 9-5 - but is "Office" really
the killer feature that Microsoft feels will drive their future growth, or
perhaps they are simply looking to follow their existing revenue streams and
no longer drive new features?
