so one shiny nokia e65, and a bit of frustration, later; have found the following recipe for getting the phone to sync correctly with iSync.

Firstly download the plugin from [Nokia](http://www.nokia.com/A4299040)

Then install and if you get a rather cryptic error like this:

```bash
[Nokia E65] Device is not available or synchronization was cancelled.
Close dialogs and applications on the phone and try again.
Device “Nokia E65″ synchronization failed
```
Looks like the Nokia installer drops the plugin into a strange location (originally it allowed isync to work once and then I got the error message

```bash
$ cd /Applications/iSync.app/Contents/PlugIns/
$ mv Nokia-E65.phoneplugin/ ApplePhoneConduit.syncdevice/Contents/PlugIns/
```
Once this is done, restart isync and all should work!
