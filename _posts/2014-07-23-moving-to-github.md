So I'm a big dabbler when it comes to my personal site/pages, over the years
I've moved from the following technologies/software to host:

* Simple HTML - 1999
* [Roxen][1] - 2005
* [Wordpress][2]
* [Drupal][3]
* [Wordpress][2] (again)
* [Blogger][4]
* [Ghost][5]

I've had a dabble with Jekyll in the past (specifically [Heckle][6]) whilst I
was playing with moving things to Ghost and given I have already migrated all of
my content into [Markdown][7] it sounded like the best option (especially given
I don't have to then host the application somewhere)

I'm sure I'll be moving it along to something else but isn't that part of
life's rich tapestry!
