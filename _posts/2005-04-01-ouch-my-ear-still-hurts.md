well, finally tried out CQB (close quarter battle), definitely seems to be lot of full-auto with hicap mags, so youâ€™re looking at pretty much being suppressed/suppressing all the time - so normally you move and get shot down in a hail of plastic!

Had a restricted ammo loadout game which was seriously good fun, Mr MP5K with a midcap worked really well in semi-auto mode. Got a few kills before running out of ammo (bloody glock got a jam - go figure)

still, interesting, albeit painful - need a helmet and a better facemask.

heh
