* 1 red onion
* 200g new potatoes

1. put potatoes in steamer for 20 minutes to cook
1. heat up pan, add oil and soften cut onion for 5 minutes
1. add chicken and brown for 3 minutes, add 2 tspn of massaman curry paste
1. cook for further 6 minutes
1. add chicken stock and coconut milk and cover with saucepan lid
